<p>The love I have for photography.<br><br>

When I was a little girl I used to love being in front of the camera. The idea of being captured in a picture was a
fixation that I loved. This all changed once I took a step back to be the person taking the photo. Capturing things
through a lens that could forever be remembered made me realize that this isn’t just a hobby, but rather a passion. I
wanted to photograph everything I came across, but I think what really caught my attention was capturing the moments
people have.<br><br>

Once I finished my matric, I got accepted into BCom Logistics with a full bursary. As the time got closer to start my
studies, it occurred to me that this isn’t the life I want to pursue. My passion for photography led me into making the
decision to start my own company that aims to capture moments and make them memories. My experience with being some
professional photographers’ helping hand has given me the opportunity to develop my photography skills and given their
knowledge, I am able to develop my own shooting style.<br><br>

Every picture has its own story and they are meant to be captured. Let me help you keep your memories alive with only a
few clicks!
